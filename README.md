# O365-Scripts
A collection of scripts related to AD/O365 automation tasks

### About this repo
Inside this repo are a handful of scrpts that are used in a production environment to automate some repetitive tasks

### How to use this repo
Inside each folder you'll find the PowerShell script, a vbs file used to launch the script, a readme file with more info about the script, and an XML file that's used by the script (if applicable)

#### Disclamer
I don't claim to be a PowerShell expert, and as such these scripts may not be doing stuff in the most efficient/best way there is. These scripts are the result of hours of playing and testing. If there's something that could be done better I'm more than happy to change it inside the script!
